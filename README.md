**Merkle Tree**

In *MerkleTreeSolution.scala*, I use the merkle tree data structure concept to hashing a sequence of bytes, this simulates how a blockchain hashing process works. Here I apply tail recursion to solve the problem.

**Fold Right Functions**

In the *FoldRightFunctions.scala* file I make my own implementation of sum, elem, filter, map using only scala's foldRight function. That's a powerful way to work with lists.

**Bowling Score System**

In BowlingScoreSolution.scala I performed the implementation of a bowling scoring program in a purely functional way, here I use, tail recursion, pattern matching and sequences.
