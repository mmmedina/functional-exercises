**Merkle Tree**

In *MerkleTree.scala*, I use the merkle tree data structure concept to hashing a sequence of bytes, this simulates how a blockchain hashing process works. Here I apply tail recursion to solve the problem.

---

**Bowling Score System**

In BowlingScore.scala I performed the implementation of a bowling scoring program in a purely functional way, here I use, tail recursion, pattern matching and sequences.

---

**Fold Right Functions**

In the *FoldRightFunctions.scala* file I make my own implementation of sum, elem, filter, map using only scala's foldRight function. That's a powerful way to work with lists.

---

**Count Distinct Characters**

Inside *CountDistinctCharacters.scala* I make an application that given a string, return the number of distinct characters
